# CLAUDE.md

## Codebase Navigation
**Always read `CODEBASE_INDEX.md` before opening any source file.**
It contains the complete file map with exports and purpose for every file.
Use it to locate the exact file you need, then read only that file.


This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

knowledge-hub — a knowledge management system (early stage, no code yet).

License: Apache 2.0

## Current State

The repository is in its initial setup phase with no source code, build system, or documentation beyond the LICENSE file. As the project takes shape, this file should be updated to reflect the real architecture, commands, and conventions.

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
